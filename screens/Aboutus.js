      <Text> Door de’ Delights is a food-delivery application that makes ordering and food takeaways easy and efficient.
        The app allows the user to order meals, desserts, and beverages by choice of their restaurant and cafes. 
        As the whole world is moving into digitization, Door de’ Delights have made the ordering and delivery of food convenient and effortless.
        We have designed to reduce the excessive and unnecessary paperwork from restaurants and also for having to wait in long lines for food. 
        The items list and the food category are available in the database to place an order multiple times. 
        Once the order is placed, the restaurant's employee processes the order, which is either delivered to the customer at an expected timeframe or made ready for self-pickup. 
        It also shows the restaurant's availability and preparation time or the estimated delivery time of food items from the restaurant venue to the customer's location.
